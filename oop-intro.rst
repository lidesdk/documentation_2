Objects and Classes on Lua
==========================


A tutorial mode, this paper will try to explain Object Oriented model 
proposed by Lide and adaptations made in the base language (`Lua <http://www.lua.org>`)
so that the programmer can design and implement their own classes or 
even modify aspects of Lide framework.

Within the world of *Lua* are different implementations/adaptations of
OOP, some are shaped and other projects are simple scripts that help us 
interact with classes, subclasses, methods and properties within the 
programming language.

For various reasons we decided to take a small but highly customizable
and scalable library that suits our needs as a project, such 
implementation was called `yaci.lua <http://lua-users.org/wiki/YetAnotherClassImplementation>`_ 
(for `Julien Patte <https://github.com/jpatte>`_) we include it within
the core and made some minor modifications to be adequate to what we 
wanted.


Making a class
**************

Basically there are two ways to define a new class:

Calling th function ``lide.class()`` or using the method ``BaseObject:subclass()``

When you are creating a class must specify a name for it, this is not 
absolutely necessary, but can be helpful at the time of debug their 
applications. **If you do not specify the class name will be called 
"Unnamed".**

When you use ``Object:subclass()``, the new class will be directly a 
subclass of Object_ on the other hand ``lide.class()`` accepts a 
second argument, which will be another superclass for your object if 
you do not specify a superclass, the Object_ class will be chosen.

.. note::

  This means that all classes are subclasses of :ref:`Object<ClassObject>`.


An example can illustrate better:

.. code-block:: lua
  
  local newClass = lide.class

  -- 'Human' is a subclass of 'BaseObject'
  Human = newClass("Human")
  
  -- 'Engineer' is a subclass of 'Human'
  Engineer = newclass("Engineer", Human)
  
  -- 'Student' is another subclass of 'Human'
  Student = Human:subclass("Student")

----------------------------------------------------------------------



Defining our class
******************

Constructor
+++++++++++

Naturally our classes can define a constructor, or not...

To define our constructors, we can do:

.. code-block:: lua

   function Human:Human(name, year)
      self.name = name
      self.year   = year
   end

   function Engineer:Engineer(name, year, title)
      self.super:init(name, year) --> calls the superclass constructor
      self.title = title
   end

----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. important::

  Subclasses can call the constructor of its superclasses through the 
  field super ``self.super:init()``. Note that ``Object:init()`` there 
  however, it is recommended never to use it.



Methods
+++++++

Methods can be defined in a very simple way:

.. code-block::

  function Human:Greet()
      return "Hello World";
  end

  function Engineer:Read( book )
      print("Reading: ”..book)
  end

----------------------------------------------------------------------



Lua events (meta-methods)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Do not confuse these events with the class Event_. These events 
correspond to interactions between objects in the programming language,
some of these may be: ``__tostring``, ``__add``, ``__eq``.

For more information on methods and meta-meta-tables in Lua see the 
language reference.

You can also define events for the class instances, in the same way 
you define the methods:

.. code-block::
  
  function Human:__tostring ()
      return “a Human called: ” .. self.nombre .. “, have “ .. self.edad .. “ years old.”
  end

  function Engineer:__tostring()
      return “A Engineer of “.. self.titulo .. “ called: ” .. self.nombre .. “, have “ .. self.edad .. “ years old.”
  end

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Any event can be used, except and ``__newindex`` ``__index`` which are 
necessary for the operation of the library.

You can use this feature to define operators as ``__add``, ``__eq``, 
etc. ``__tostring`` is a really useful event class Object_ implements 
a standard version it simply returns "a xxx" where 'xxx' is the name of 
the class of that instance.



Instantiation
+++++++++++++

Every class has the ``:new()`` method, used for instantiation. All the 
arguments we pass to this method are passed to the constructor:

.. code-block::

  Anthony = Human:new (“Anthony”, 33)
  Camila  = Engineer:new (“Camila”, 21, “Electronica”)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The result is the same as if you "called" classes directly:

.. code-block::

  Julieth = Human (“Julieth”, 13)
  Jefferson = Engineer (“Jefferson”, 23, “Sistemas”)

----------------------------------------------------------------------



Classes methods
+++++++++++++++

As ``:subclass()`` and ``:new()``, classes have some other methods:

==================  ==================================================
  Class Method        Description
==================  ==================================================
 ``:inherits()``     Can be used to check if class inherits from another.
                      i.e.: ``Button:inherits(Control)`` returns ``true``
 ``:name()``         Returns name of class (specified when you created it)
 ``:super()``        Returns the superclass
 ``:made()``         Is used to check if an instance implements class
                      i.e.:, ``Number:made(numberZero)`` returns ``true``
 ``:virtual()``      Used to explicitly declare virtual/ methods
 ``:cast()``         Are used for casting
 ``:trycast()``      Are used for casting
==================  ==================================================



Running
*******

Intance's methods
+++++++++++++++++

All instances allow access to variables defined in the constructor of 
your class (and its superclasses). They also have a ``:class()`` method
that returns the class, and ``.super`` field that is used to access 
the superclass if you overwrote the method, see:

.. code-block::

  A = newclass("A")
  function A:test() print(self.a) end
  A:virtual("test") -- declare test() as being virtual; see below
  function A:init(a) self.a = a end

  B = newclass("B", A)
  function B:test() print(self.a .. "+" .. self.b) end
  function B:init(b) self.super:init(5) self.b = b end

  b = B:new(3)
  b:test()         -- prints "5+3"
  b.super:test()   -- prints "5"
  print(b.a)       -- prints "5"
  print(b.super.a) -- prints "5"

Superclass members are created (and initialized) when the ``self.super:init()`` 
is called. You generally must call this method at the beginning of the 
constructor to initialize. Note that b is an instance of ``B``, ``b.super`` 
is simply an instance of ``A`` (then beware, here ``super`` is dynamic,
 not static).


Static variables
++++++++++++++++

Every time you define a new method for a class, it is recorded in a 
table ``static``; in this way we will not mix the methods of classes 
with class services. This table is accessible via the ``static`` field. 
This generally allows access to static variables in classes, for example:

.. code-block::

  A = newclass("A")
  function A:init(a) self.a = a end
  A.test = 5   -- a static variable in A

  a = A(3)
  prints(a.a)           -- prints 3
  prints(a.test)        -- prints 5
  prints(A.test)        -- prints nil (!)
  prints(A.static.test) -- prints 5

----------------------------------------------------------------------



Virtual Methods
+++++++++++++++

The class methods are not virtual by default, which means implicitly 
that they are not overwritten by potential implementations of subclasses. 
To declare a method as virtual you have to declare explicitly using the 
``:virtual()`` in its class. The call to ``:virtual()`` should be 
written out of any method, and before the method definition:

.. code-block::

  A = newclass("A")

  function A:whoami()
    return "A"
  end

  A:virtual("whoami") -- whoami() is declared virtual

  function A:test()
    print(self:whoami())
  end

  B = newclass("B", A)

  function B:whoami()
    return "B"
  end
    -- no need to use B:virtual() here
  myB = B()
  myB:test() -- prints "B"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

With this it is also possible to declare some methods as abstract 
(b.p. purely virtual methods); you just call ``A:virtual()`` with the 
method name without defining it.

An error will occur if you try to call without defining it before in 
the hierarchy.

Example here:

.. code-block::

  A = newclass("A")

  A:virtual("whoami") -- whoami() is an abstract method

  function A:test()
    print(self:whoami())
  end

  B = newclass("B", A)

  function B:whoami() -- define whoami() here
    return "B"
  end

  myB = B()
  myB:test() -- will print "B"

  myA = A()  -- no error here! 
  myA:test() -- but will raise an error here


Private attributes
++++++++++++++++++

By default, subclasses inherit all methods and all the attributes 
defined by their (s) type (s) father. This can lead to some confusion 
when defining attributes that share the same name at different levels 
in the hierarchy:

.. code-block::

  A = newclass("A")

  function A:init()
    self.x = 42  -- define an attribute here for internal purposes
  end

  function A:doSomething()
    self.x = 0   -- change attribute value
    -- do something here...
  end


  B = A:subclass("B")

  function B:init(x)
    self.super:init()   -- call the superclass's constructor
    self.x = x          -- B defines an 'x' attribute. Problem: 'x' is actually already defined by A!
  end

  function B:doYourJob()
    self.x = 5
    self.doSomething()
    print(self.x)       -- prints "0": 'x' has been modified by A because A defined it first
  end

----------------------------------------------------------------------


You can define private attributes in a class depending on the order in
which these attributes are initialized.

Note that "private" is not the best term to describe it here (because 
this is not a real protection mechanism); I prefer to speak of attribute 
"shared" and "shared" between classes and subclasses.

You will also notice that this distinction is made by the same subclass 
(and not by the superclass), which can decide (in its constructor) which 
attributes of the superclass can be possibly inherited from the 
superclass or overwritten privately.

By law, you almost always define the attributes of the class before 
calling the constructor of its superclass.

Let's see this example with a small change in ``B:init()``:

.. code-block::

  A = newclass("A")
  function A:init()
    self.x = 42  -- define an attribute here for internal purposes
  end

  function A:doSomething()
    self.x = 0   -- change attribute value
    -- do something here...
  end

  B = A:subclass("B")

  function B:init(x)
    self.x = x          -- B defines a private 'x' attribute
    self.super:init()   -- call the superclass's constructor
  end

  function B:doYourJob()
    self.x = 5
    self.doSomething()
    print(self.x)       -- prints "5": 'x' has not been modified by A
    print(self.super.x) -- prints "0": this is the 'x' attribute that was used by A
  end

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see the different behaviors of the attributes ``X`` and ``Y`` 
come in the order of initialization in the constructor.

The first class that defines an attribute will obtain possession of 
that attribute, even if some superclasses declare an attribute with 
the same name "after" in the initialization process.

I personally suggest initialize all attributes "unshared" the beginning 
of the constructor, then call the superclass constructor, then a 
Eventually use some of the superclass' methods. On the contrary if you 
want to access an attribute defined by a superclass does not set this 
value before the superclass constructor has done it.


Castings
++++++++

The Castings are very useful if you need access to a (non-virtual) 
method from a localized higher in the class hierarchy method. This can 
be done with the ``:cast()`` and ``:trycast()`` of all kinds.

Here's a simple example:

.. code-block::

  A = newclass("A")
  function A:foo()
    print(self.x)         -- prints "nil"! There is no field 'x' at A's level
    selfB = B:cast(self)  -- explicit casting into a B
    print(selfB.x)        -- prints "5"
  end
  B = newclass("B",A)
  function B:init(x) 
      self.x = x
  end

  myB = B(5)
  myB:foo()
  C:cast(x) 

Try searching for the sub-object or super-object ``x`` corresponding 
to the ``class C``, Looking up and down the hierarchy. Intuitively we 
will get ``myB.super == A:cast(MYB)`` and ``myb == B:cast(myB.super)``.

Of course this works with more than two levels of inheritance. If the 
casting fails an error occurs.

``C:trycast(x)`` does exactly the same except that this simply returns 
``nil`` when the casting is impossible rather than an error occurs.
